                <p>
                    Hi! I am Engr.Saima Kousar, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Iâ€™m
                    currently on a journey to become a skilled web developer, with a strong focus on front-end
                    technologies
                    like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love learning new things, solving problems, and turning creative
                    ideas

                    into real, working web experiences.</p>

            <div class="mission">
                <h3>My mission</h3>
                <p>
                    My goal is to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that deliver seamless user
                    experience. I believe a great website should not only look polished but also feel smooth and
                    intuitive for users. By combining design principles with front-end coding, I create
                    digital solutions that are both visually appealing and highly functional across all screen sizes.

                </p>

            <div class="Skills">
                <h3>My Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm always expanding my front-end development toolkit. Currently, I work with HTML and CSS for
                    layout and styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and Git for version control. I focus on creating
                    responsive designs that adapt well to both desktop and mobile. I'm also exploring tools like
                    Tailwind CSS, NodeJs to enhance visual design and build more interactive web
                    experiences.</p>
